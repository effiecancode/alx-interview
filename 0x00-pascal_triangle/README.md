# pascal_triangle

* Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it in the previous row.

* The task is to create a Python script for generating Pascal's triangle

* My solution demonstrates the use of basic Python syntax, control flow, and data structures to implement the logic for generating Pascal's triangle.
